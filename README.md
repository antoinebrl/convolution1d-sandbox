# Convolution Interactive Playground

Convolutions are core to deep learning recent success, especially in computer vision.
This interactive visualization help to grasp a better understanding 
of the step-by-step processing. 

User can select different kernels and input signals among the predefined
functions. Another option drag the dots to the wanted level.
The app also illustrates the importance of the padding, the dilatation
and stride parameters.
